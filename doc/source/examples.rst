Spice simulation examples
=========================
In TheSyDeKick, 'inverter' entity contains example setups for simple transient
simulation with spice-type simulators. In the following, more complex examples
are presented to support the designers willing to learn the awesome feartures 
of this great toool.

In the very unlikely and unfortunate case there is no example that you are looking for, please
provide it once you have figured out how to do what you were looking for. The source of this 
information is 'spice/doc/source/examples.rst' 

With love,
TheSyDeKick developers.
